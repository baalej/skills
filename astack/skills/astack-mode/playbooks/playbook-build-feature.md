# Playbook: Build a Feature

**Use it when:**
- "Build this feature"
- "I have a design; now I need to implement it"
- "Take the architecture and make it work"

**Principles:**
- Quality Over Speed (prove it works before declaring done)
- Code is Documentation (clear names, obvious structure)
- Sequence Verifiable Units (small, independent commits)
- Foundational Thinking (architecture before logic)
- Build the Lever (automate if repeatable)

---

## Step 1: Scaffold First

**What to do:**
- Implement the data structures and type definitions from the design
- Build empty shells for functions (signatures, pseudocode bodies)
- Don't implement business logic yet; just the shape
- Principle: Foundational Thinking

**How to verify:**
- Code compiles (or lints passes); types are defined; no logic yet
- Structure matches the design exactly

---

## Step 2: Implement in Small Units

**What to do:**
- Break the feature into independently testable pieces
- Each piece should be small enough to review in 10-30 min
- Implement one piece, verify it works, commit
- Principle: Sequence Verifiable Units

**How to verify:**
- Each commit has passing tests/verification
- PR is reviewable (each commit makes sense in isolation)

---

## Step 3: Verify Each Unit

**What to do:**
- After each piece: does it work on the real artifact?
- Run the code, observe the output, inspect the diff
- If a piece breaks, fix it before moving to the next
- Principle: Quality Over Speed, Prove It Works

**How to verify:**
- Tests pass, behavior verified, performance measured
- No regressions in existing functionality

---

## Step 4: Code Review Yourself

**What to do:**
- Before declaring done, review your own code
- Are names clear? Is structure obvious?
- Would a reader unfamiliar with this code understand it in 5 min?
- Are there comments that could be replaced by better naming/structure?
- Principle: Code is Documentation

**How to verify:**
- Self-review checklist passed
- No comments explaining WHAT; only WHY when necessary

---

## Step 5: Integration Test

**What to do:**
- Test the feature end-to-end on the real artifact
- Test the happy path, edge cases, error cases
- Measure performance; confirm it meets the bar
- Principle: Quality Over Speed, Prove It Works

**How to verify:**
- Feature works as specified
- Performance log shows acceptable numbers
- No known bugs remain

---

## Step 6: Handoff

**What to do:**
- Commit messages explain each change and why
- PR description explains the feature, tradeoffs, verification done
- Link to the design doc for context
- Make it clear for code review and future maintenance

**How to verify:**
- PR that a reviewer can understand and verify
- All decisions are documented and traceable
