# Playbook: Design/Architecture

**Use it when:**
- "Design this feature; I want the architecture solid before I code"
- "I'm about to write code that crosses boundaries; help me get the shape right"
- "What should the data model look like?"

**Principles:**
- Foundational Thinking (data structures first)
- Exhaust the Design Space (2-3 competing designs)
- Code is Documentation (interfaces should be self-explanatory)
- Plans Evolve; Principles Don't (be willing to redesign if wrong)

---

## Step 1: Ground in Reality

**What to do:**
- Understand the existing systems this touches
- Document what currently exists, what constraints exist
- Trace how data flows through related systems
- Principle: understand before designing

**How to verify:**
- Trace showing how data flows through related systems
- Clear list of constraints and existing patterns

---

## Step 2: Sketch the Candidate Designs

**What to do:**
- Design A: One approach
- Design B: A structurally different approach
- Design C (optional): A third alternative
- Each design should include: data structures, types/schemas, API surface, flow
- Principle: Exhaust the Design Space

**How to verify:**
- 2-3 design sketches with pseudocode or types
- Each design is genuinely different, not minor variations

---

## Step 3: Evaluate Against Red Flags

**What to do:**
- Does any design have shallow pass-through methods?
- Does any design leak internal details to callers?
- Are types weak (any, Object) instead of precise?
- Does the design match the problem, or force the problem into a shape?
- Principle: Foundational Thinking, Code is Documentation

**How to verify:**
- Red flag analysis for each design
- Designs ranked by quality against red flags

---

## Step 4: Choose and Document

**What to do:**
- Pick the best design based on interface simplicity, flexibility, correctness
- Document why you chose it: what tradeoffs are you making?
- What does it do well? What's the weakness?
- Principle: Plans Evolve; Principles Don't (acknowledge tradeoffs)

**How to verify:**
- Design decision doc with reasoning
- Trade-offs are explicit and justified

---

## Step 5: Validate the Interface

**What to do:**
- Write code that *uses* the interface (caller-first, Principle: Foundational Thinking)
- Does the interface feel natural to use?
- Can a caller use it correctly without knowing internals?
- If it feels awkward, redesign

**How to verify:**
- Example code showing how a caller will use this
- Interface feels natural and intuitive to use

---

## Step 6: Handoff

**What to do:**
- Document the chosen design with types/pseudocode
- Explain the tradeoffs (why this design, why not the others)
- List the assumptions (what might need to change?)
- Make it clear for implementation

**How to verify:**
- Design doc that implementation can follow exactly
- All assumptions and tradeoffs are documented
